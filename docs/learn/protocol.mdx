# About Terra

## What is Luna Classic?

The Luna Classic protocol is the leading decentralized and open-source public blockchain protocol for [algorithmic stablecoins](https://classic-docs.terra.money/docs/learn/glossary.html#algorithmic-stablecoin). Using a combination of open market [arbitrage](https://classic-docs.terra.money/docs/learn/glossary.html#arbitrage) incentives and decentralized Oracle voting, the Luna Classic protocol creates stablecoins that consistently track the price of any fiat currency. Users can spend, save, trade, or exchange Luna Classic stablecoins instantly, all on the Terra blockchain. Luna Classic provides its holders with staking rewards and governance power. The Terra Luna Classic ecosystem is a quickly expanding network of decentralized applications, creating a stable demand for Terra Luna Classic and increasing the price of Luna Classic.

## Terra Classic and Luna Classic

The protocol consists of two main tokens, Terra Classic and Luna Classic.

Terra: Stablecoins that track the price of [fiat currencies](https://classic-docs.terra.money/docs/learn/glossary.html#fiat-currency). Users mint new Terra by [burning](https://classic-docs.terra.money/docs/learn/glossary.html#burn) Luna. Stablecoins are named for their fiat counterparts. For example, the base Terra Classic stablecoin tracks the price of the [IMF’s SDR](https://classic-docs.terra.money/docs/learn/glossary.html#sdr), named TerraSDR, or SDT. Other stablecoin denominations include TerraUSD or USTC, and TerraKRW or KRTC. All Terra Classic denominations exist in the same pool.

Luna Classic: The Terra Luna Classic protocol’s native [staking](https://classic-docs.terra.money/docs/learn/glossary.html#staking) token that absorbs the price volatility of Terra. Luna is used for [governance](https://classic-docs.terra.money/docs/learn/protocol.html#governance) and in mining. Users stake Luna Classic to validators who record and verify transactions on the [blockchain](https://classic-docs.terra.money/docs/learn/glossary.html#blockchain) in exchange for rewards from transaction fees. The more Terra is used, the more Luna Classic is worth.

## How the Terra Classic Protocol Works

Stablecoins
Stablecoins are the main feature of the Terra Classic protocol: crypto assets that track the price of an underlying currency. As a digital form of currency, Terra Classic stablecoins can be used just like [fiat currency](https://classic-docs.terra.money/docs/learn/glossary.html#fiat-currency) with [blockchain’s](https://classic-docs.terra.money/docs/learn/glossary.html#blockchain) added benefits: an unchangeable public ledger, instant transactions, faster settlement times, and fewer fees.

Stablecoins are only valuable to users if they maintain their [price peg](https://classic-docs.terra.money/docs/learn/glossary.html#peg). The Terra Classic protocol uses the basic market forces of supply and demand to maintain the price of Terra Classic. When the demand for Terra Classic is high and the supply is limited, the price of Terra Classic increases. When the demand for Terra Classic is low and the supply is too large, the price of Terra Classic decreases. The protocol ensures the supply and demand of Terra is always balanced, leading to a stable price.

## Expansion and Contraction

Imagine the whole Terra Classic economy as two pools: one for Terra and one for Luna. To maintain the price of Terra Classic, the Luna Classic supply pool adds to or subtracts from Terra Classic's supply. Users burn Lunc to mint Terra Clasic and burn Terra Classic to mint Lunc, all incentivized by the protocol’s algorithmic [market module](https://classic-docs.terra.money/docs/develop/module-specifications/spec-market.html).

Expansion: When the price of Terra Classic is high relative to its [peg](https://classic-docs.terra.money/docs/learn/glossary.html#peg), supply is too small and demand is too high. The protocol incentivizes users to burn Lunc and mint Terra Classic. The new supply of Terra Classic makes its pool larger, balancing supply with demand. Users mint more Terra Classic from burned Lunc until Terra Classic reaches its target price. The Lunc pool gets smaller in this process, increasing the price of Lunc.

Contraction: When the price of Terra Classic is too low relative to its peg, supply is too large and demand is too low. The protocol incentives users to burn Terra Classic and mint Luna Classic. The decrease in Terra Classic's supply causes scarcity, and the price of Terra Classic increases. More Luna Classic is minted from burned Terra Classic until Terra Classic reaches its target price. The Lunc pool increases and lowers in price.

Luna Classic is the variable counterpart to the stable asset Terra Classic. By modulating supply, Lunc’s price increases as the demand for stablecoins increases.


## Validators

Validators are the miners of the Terra [blockchain](https://classic-docs.terra.money/docs/learn/glossary.html#blockchain). They are responsible for securing the Terra blockchain and ensuring its accuracy. Validators run programs called full nodes which allow them to verify each transaction made on the Terra network. Validators propose blocks, vote on their validity, and add each new block to the chain in exchange for staking rewards from transaction fees. Users can stake their Luna to validators in exchange for staking rewards. Validators also play an important role in the governance of the Terra protocol.

For more information on validators, visit the [Validator FAQ](https://classic-docs.terra.money/docs/full-node/manage-a-terra-validator/faq.html).


### Consensus

The Luna Classic blockchain is a proof-of-stake blockchain, powered by the [Cosmos SDK](https://cosmos.network/) and secured by a system of verification called the Tendermint consensus.

The following process explains how Tendermint consensus works. For more information on the Tendermint consensus, visit the [official Tendermint documentation](https://docs.tendermint.com/).

1. A validator called a **proposer** is chosen to submit a new block of transactions.
2. Validators vote in two rounds on whether they accept or reject the proposed block. If a block is rejected, a new proposer is selected and the process starts again.
3. If accepted, the block is signed and added to the chain.
4. The transaction fees from the block are distributed as staking rewards to validators and delegators. Proposers get rewarded extra for their participation.

This process repeats, adding new blocks of transactions to the chain. Each validator has a copy of all transactions made on the network, which they compare against the proposed block of transactions before voting. Because multiple independent validators take place in consensus voting, it is infeasible for any false block to be accepted. In this way, validators protect the integrity of the Terra blockchain and ensure the validity of each transaction.

## Staking

Staking is the process of bonding Luna Classic to a validator in exchange for staking rewards.

The Terra protocol only allows the top 130 validators to participate in consensus. A validator's rank is determined by their stake or the total amount of Luna bonded to them. Although validators can bond Luna to themselves, they mainly amass larger stakes from delegators. Validators with larger stakes get chosen more often to propose new blocks and earn proportionally more rewards.

To learn how to stake your Luna and earn staking rewards, visit the [Station staking guide](station/staking.mdx)

### Delegators

Delegators are users who want to receive rewards from consensus without running a full node. Any user that stakes Luna is a delegator. Delegators stake their Luna to a validator, adding to a validator’s weight, or total stake. In return, delegators receive a portion of transaction fees as staking rewards.

<Admonition type="caution" icon="☢️" title="Who owns staked Luna?">

Staked Luna never leaves the possession of the delegator. Even though it can’t be traded freely, staked Luna is never owned by a validator. For more information, visit the [Validator FAQ](../full-node/manage-a-terra-validator/faq.mdx#can-a-validator-run-away-with-a-delegators-luna).

</Admonition>

### Phases of Luna Classic

To start receiving rewards, delegators bond their Luna Classic to a validator. The bonding process adds a delegator’s Luna Classic to a validator’s stake, which helps validators to participate in consensus.

Luna Classic exists in the following three phases:

- **Unbonded**: Luna that can be freely traded and is not staked to a validator.
- **Bonded**: Luna that is staked to a validator. Bonded Luna accrues staking rewards. Luna bonded to validators in Station can’t be traded freely.
- **Unbonding**: Luna that is in the process of becoming unbonded from a validator and does not accrue rewards. This process takes 21 days to complete.

### Bonding, staking, and delegating

Generally, the terms bonding, staking, and delegating can be used interchangeably, as they happen in the same step. A delegator delegates Lunc to a validator, the Lunc gets bonded to the validator, and the bonded Lunc gets added to the validator’s stake.

Delegators can bond Luna to any validator in the [active set](https://classic-docs.terra.money/docs/learn/glossary.html#active-set) using the delegate function in Terra Station. Delegators start earning staking rewards the moment they bond or stake to a validator.

### Unbonding

Delegators can unbond or unstake their Lunc using the undelegate function in Terra Station. The unbonding process takes 21 days to complete. During this period, the unbonding Luna can’t be traded, and no staking rewards accrue.

<Admonition type="caution" icon="☢️">

After funds are undelegated, they will be locked for a period of 21 days. Once this process has started, there is no option for reversal. After this period has concluded, the funds will be transferred to your wallet where they will once again be available to carry out transactions. Users can redelegate to another validator instantly without waiting for the unbonding period to end. 

</Admonition>

The 21-day unbonding period assists in the long-term stability of Luna Classic. The unbonding period discourages volatility by locking staked Luna in the system for at least 21 days. In exchange, delegators receive staking rewards, further incentivizing network stability.

### Redelegation

Redelegating instantly sends staked Luna from one validator to another. Instead of waiting for the 21-day unstaking period, a user can redelegate their staked Lunc at any time using Terra Station’s redelegate function. Validators receiving redelegations are barred from further redelegating any amount of Lunc to any validator for 21 days.

<Admonition type="caution" icon="☢️">

When a user redelegates staked Lunc from one validator to another, the validator receiving the staked Lunc is barred from making further redelegation transactions for 21 days. This requirement only applies to the wallet that made the redelegation transaction.

</Admonition>

## Rewards

The Terra Luna Classic protocol incentivizes validators and delegators with staking rewards. Staking rewards come from two sources: gas and swap fees.

[Gas](https://classic-docs.terra.money/docs/learn/fees.html#gas): Compute fees added on to each transaction to avoid spamming. Validators set minimum gas prices and reject transactions that have implied gas prices below this threshold.


For more information on fees, visit the [fee page](./fees.mdx).

At the end of every block, transaction fees are distributed to each validator and their delegators proportional to their staked amount. Validators can keep a portion of rewards to pay for their services. This portion is called commission. The rest of the rewards are distributed to delegators according to their staked amounts.

### Slashing

Running a validator is a big responsibility. Validators must meet strict standards and constantly monitor and participate in the consensus process. Slashing is the penalty for misbehaving validators. When a validator gets slashed, they lose a small portion of their stake as well as a small portion of their delegator's stake. Slashed validators also get jailed, or excluded, from consensus for a period of time.

<Admonition type="danger" icon="🔥" title="The risks of staking">

Slashing affects validators and delegators. When a validator gets slashed, delegators who stake to that validator also get slashed. Slashing is proportional to a delegator's staked amount. Though slashing is rare and usually results in a small penalty, it does occur. Delegators should monitor their validators closely, do their research, and understand the risks of staking Luna.

</Admonition>

Slashing occurs under the following conditions:

- **Double signing**: When a validator signs two different blocks with the same chain ID at the same height.
- **Downtime**: When a validator is unresponsive or can't be reached for a period of time.
- **Missed votes**: When a validator misses votes in consensus.

Validators monitor each other closely and can submit evidence of misbehavior. Once discovered, the misbehaving validator will have a small portion of their funds slashed. Offending validators will also be jailed or excluded from consensus for a period of time. Even simple issues such as malfunctions or downtimes from upgrading can lead to slashing.

For more information on slashing, visit the [slashing module](../develop/module-specifications/spec-slashing.mdx).

## Governance

The Terra Classic protocol is a decentralized public [blockchain](https://classic-docs.terra.money/docs/learn/glossary.html#blockchain) governed by community members. Governance is the democratic process that allows users and validators to make changes to the Terra protocol. Community members submit, vote, and implement proposals.

To learn how to vote with your staked Luna Classic or submit proposals, visit the [Terra Station governance guide](https://classic-docs.terra.money/docs/learn/terra-station/governance.html).

### Proposals

Proposals start as ideas within the community. A community member drafts and submits a proposal alongside an initial deposit.
The most common proposal types include:

- `ParameterChangeProposal`: To change the parameters defined in each module.
- `CommunityPoolSpendProposal`: To spend funds in the community pool.
- `TextProposal` : To handle other issues like large directional changes or any decision requiring manual implementation.

### Voting process

Community members vote with their staked Lunc. One staked Lunc equals one vote. If a user fails to specify a vote, their vote defaults to the validator they are staked to. Validators vote with their entire stake unless specified by delegators. For this reason, it is very important that each delegator votes according to their preferences.

The following is a basic outline of the governance process. Visit the [governance module](https://classic-docs.terra.money/docs/develop/module-specifications/spec-governance.html) for more details.

1. A user submits a proposal and a one-week deposit period begins.

2. Users deposit Luna as collateral to back the proposal. This period ends once a minimum threshold of 1M Luna Classic is deposited. Deposits are to protect against spam.

3. The one-week vote period begins.
   The voting options are:

   - `Yes`: In favor.
   - `No`: Not in favor.
   - `NoWithVeto`: Not in favor, the deposit should be burned.
   - `Abstain`: Voter abstains. Abstain votes count toward meeting `Quorum`.

4. The votes are tallied.

   Proposals pass if they meet three conditions:

   - `Quorum` is met: at least 30% of all staked Lunc must vote.
   - The total number of `NoWithVeto` votes is less than 33.4% of the total vote.
   - `Threshold` is met: the number of `Yes` votes is greater than the number of `no` and `NoWithVeto` votes. `Abstain` votes are excluded from the `Threshold` tally.

   If the previous conditions are not met, the proposal is rejected.

   For a more in-depth look at the tallying process, visit the [Governance module specification](../develop/module-specifications/spec-governance.mdx#tallying).

5. Accepted proposals get put into effect.
6. Deposits get refunded or burned.

Once accepted, the changes described in a governance proposal are automatically put into effect by the proposal handler. Generic proposals, such as a passed `TextProposal`, must be reviewed, and they must be manually implemented.

### Deposits

Deposits protect against unnecessary proposals and spam. Users can veto any proposal they deem to be spam by voting `NoWithVeto`.

If a proposal fails to meet the minimum deposit amount within the deposit period, the proposal will not enter the voting period, and the deposit will be refunded. 

Proposals that meet the minimum deposit requirement and make it to the voting period will be refunded under any vote outcome except `NoWithVeto`. If the number of `NoWithVeto` votes is above 33.4% of the total vote, the deposit will be burned. Deposits will be refunded under any other condition.
